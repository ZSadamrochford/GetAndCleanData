### Final Project

The run_analysis.R script downloads and cleans data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip using the following steps:

1. Download data to current workint directory inside "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
2. Unzips ZIP files.
3. Merges files using `cbind` and `rbind` (assumes data is ordered identically).
4. Cleans column names in Tidy format.
5. Drops all by mean and standard deviation metric columns.
6. Aggregates by acitivity and subject, and calculates mean of each field.
7. Saves results to `activity_subj_mean.txt`.
